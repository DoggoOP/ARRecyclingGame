Documentation of AR Recycling Game Development

Project Overview:
The AR Recycling Game is designed to address the pressing issue of inefficient recycling practices at my school. With only 5-10% of trash being correctly recycled and a significant proportion of items being wrongly categorized, there is a critical need for an educational intervention.

Problem Statement:
Inefficacy in recycling processes has led to a high rate of recyclable trash ending up in general bins, while a notable amount of non-recyclable items are incorrectly placed in recycling bins designated for plastics, metals, and paper.

Solution:
The AR Recycling Game offers an interactive and engaging solution, allowing users to quickly and effectively determine whether an item can be recycled. By leveraging augmented reality, the game guides users to the correct disposal methods, thus educating and encouraging proper recycling habits.

Game Features:

AR-based interface for identifying recyclable items.
Immediate feedback to users on whether the trash can be recycled, coupled with the correct recycling bin.
A demo video showcasing the game's capabilities and user interaction.
Design Thinking Process:

Empathize: I started by observing the recycling habits within the school and identified pain points in the current process.
Define: The problem was defined based on empirical evidence of recycling errors within the school's environment.
Ideate: Multiple solutions were brainstormed, with the idea of an AR game standing out due to its interactive potential.
Prototype: A functional prototype of the AR Recycling Game was developed, featuring core functionalities that address the defined problem.
Test: The prototype was tested in real-world scenarios, and feedback was gathered to refine the game.
Future Work:

Enhanced Feedback Mechanism: Plans include adding detailed explanations to educate users on why certain items are recyclable or not.
Progress Tracking: Introduction of a statistics menu to track user progress and display accumulated recycling achievements over time.
Impact and Reflection:
The AR Recycling Game serves not just as an educational tool but as a catalyst for change in the community. It transforms recycling from a mundane task into a rewarding experience. The development process underscored the importance of user-centered design and iterative development in creating impactful solutions.

Conclusion:
The AR Recycling Game stands as a testament to the power of technology in addressing environmental issues. My documentation highlights a structured and thoughtful approach to problem-solving, showcasing effective implementation of the design thinking process.
